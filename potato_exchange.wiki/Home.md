# Welcome to the PotatoExchange wiki!

Potato Exchange is a platform loosely based off of [Turnip Exchange](https://turnip.exchange/), an app for Animal Crossing: New Horizons players to post their island codes to enter other people's islands via a queueing system to exchange a fungible good (Turnips) for in-game currency (Bells) at the highest possible price. Potato Exchange uses a similar queueing system to allow users to have small, personal virtual meet-and-greets with lobby hosts.
